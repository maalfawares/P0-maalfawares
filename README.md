# Project 0: Dodge the Creeps
A tutorial implementation by Mera Alfawares.

This project follows the [Your First Game tutorial from
godotengine.org](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).

## Project Report
While working through this tutorial, what I found most challenging was trying to identify the cause of an error. Unlike other code projects that I've worked on, when something isn't working correctly, I'd typically go through the project files and read through the code to find the bug. However, with Godot engine, I had to review both the script files and the scenes. The error could be due to a misplaced Node, an incorrect property, a missing signal, and so on. This has taught me to test my game more frequently for future projects so that if an error were to occur, there is a shorter list of things I need to check at one time. 

- [ ] D-1: The repository link is submitted before the project deadline.
- [X] C-1: The tutorial has been completed.
- [X] B-1: Your <code>.gitignore</code> file is correctly specified in the repository.
- [X] A-1: The project report is complete as per the instructions.

This work would be given a D if the Save Point only applies for one of the criteria. Otherwise, it could earn an A.
